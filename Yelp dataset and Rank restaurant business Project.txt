Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that 
will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this 
first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your 
findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on 
how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where 
necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences 
and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be 
required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, 
you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting 
and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions 
you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where
indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able 
to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) 
to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout
application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact
for you reviewer.


Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
		SELECT 
			COUNT(*)
		FROM table
	
	i. 	Attribute table 	= 10000
	ii. 	Business table 		= 10000
	iii. 	Category table 		= 10000
	iv. 	Checkin table 		= 10000
	v. 	elite_years table 	= 10000 
	vi. 	friend table 		= 10000
	vii. 	hours table 		= 10000
	viii. 	photo table 		= 10000
	ix. 	review table 		= 10000
	x. 	tip table 			= 10000
	xi. 	user table 			= 10000
	

2. Find the total number of distinct records for each of the keys listed below:

		SELECT 
			COUNT(DISTINCT(key))
		FROM table

	i. 	Business 	= id: 10000
	ii. 	Hours 		= business_id: 1562
	iii. 	Category 	= business_id: 2643
	iv. 	Attribute 	= business_id: 1115
	v. 	Review 		= id:10000, business_id: 8090, user_id: 9581
	vi. 	Checkin 	= business_id: 493
	vii. 	Photo 		= id: 10000, business_id: 6493
	viii. 	Tip 		= user_id: 537, business_id: 3979
	ix. 	User 		= id: 10000
	x. 	Friend 		= user_id: 11

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. 	Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city
	or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to 
	the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
	"I choose Toronto city and Food category"

	i.	Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
	
		>> the 2-3 stars group seems to have hours longer than the 4-5 stars group.
		   because maybe the 4-5 stars group is more popular than therefore having a lot of sales Therefore, 
		   there is no need to open the shop for a long time.
		
	ii.	Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
	
		>> Yes, different, can be see from the 2-3 stars group has fewer reviews, all of which are on a 10 review level, 
		   but the 4-5 stars group has more reviews in the 15 to 26 range. clearly
	
	iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two
		groups? Explain.

		>> Yes, I noticed that Zip code and number of reviews There have some correlation. 
		   can be see that [zip code: M6R 1X3] which is usually the 2-3 stars group fewer reviews than [zip code: M6R 1A6 and M6H 1V5] 
		   which is usually the 4-5 stars group.

	SQL code used for analysis:
	
		SELECT 
			B.name,
			B.review_count,
			B.postal_code,
			H.hours,
		CASE
			WHEN hours LIKE "%monday%" THEN 1
			WHEN hours LIKE "%tuesday%" THEN 2
			WHEN hours LIKE "%wednesday%" THEN 3
			WHEN hours LIKE "%thursday%" THEN 4
			WHEN hours LIKE "%friday%" THEN 5
			WHEN hours LIKE "%saturday%" THEN 6
			WHEN hours LIKE "%sunday%" THEN 7
		END AS dist,
		CASE
			WHEN B.stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3 THEN '2-3 stars'
			WHEN B.stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5 THEN '4-5 stars'
		END AS star_rating
		FROM business B 
		INNER JOIN hours H ON B.id = H.business_id
		INNER JOIN category C ON C.business_id = B.id
		WHERE (B.city == 'Toronto' AND C.category LIKE 'Food')
		      AND (B.stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3 OR B.stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5)
		GROUP BY stars,dist
		ORDER BY dist,star_rating ASC

2.	Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What
	differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are
	closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your
	answer.
		
	i. 	Difference 1:
	
		The open businesses tend to have more star than the close business base on average
	
			Open business   >>   AVG(stars) = 3.67900943396
			Closed business >>   AVG(stars) = 3.52039473684
	
	
	ii.	Difference 2:
	
	    The open businesses tend to have more reviews than the close business base on average.
		
			Open business   >>   AVG(review_count) = 31.7570754717
			Closed business >>   AVG(review_count) = 23.1980263158

	(Add) 
	iii.	Difference 3 :

		The number of open businesses is more than the number of close businesses base on count value

			Open business   >>   COUNT(DISTINCT(id)) = 8480
			Closed business >>   AVG(review_count) = 1520
	
	
	SQL code used for analysis:
	
		SELECT 
			AVG(stars),
			AVG(review_count),
			COUNT(DISTINCT(id)),
			is_open
		FROM business
		GROUP BY is_open


	Output :

	+---------------+---------------+--------+---------+
	|      avg_star |    avg_review | counts | is_open |
	+---------------+---------------+--------+---------+
	| 3.52039473684 | 23.1980263158 |   1520 |       0 |
	| 3.67900943396 | 31.7570754717 |   8480 |       1 |
	+---------------+---------------+--------+---------+

	
	
3. 	For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you
	want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.
	
	Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment 
	analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, 
	predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a 
	user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel 
	free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide
	answers, in-line, to all of the following:

	
	i. 	Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
	
		>> Rank the cities in which restaurants business get interest and satisfaction. 
		   To be an option for business people who are interested in opening restaurants in different cities.

		   Interest and satisfaction are grouped on a level of 3 to 1 (high to low), where interest is calculated 
		   based on the number of reviews and satisfaction is calculated from the average number of stars.
		

	
	ii.	Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis
		and why you chose that data:

		>> I select the information in the restaurant business in each city. It shows both the number of reviews and the average star rating. 
		   I think the number of reviews indicates the interest of people in the restaurant and the star indicates satisfaction in the restaurant 
		   and these two variables are grouped into levels from 3 to 1 (Descending). Thus the city that have higher interest_level and 
		   satisfaction_level is the more interesting to open a restaurant business there and interest_level was rated before satisfaction due to 
		   the large number of reviews. It represents a large number of people, which is more important than satisfaction in terms of driving sales.

		   I'm interested in doing this project because I want to help business people who are interested in opening a restaurant choose 
		   a city to open their business based on the level of interest and satisfaction of people. This project will help entrepreneurs reduce 
		   their investment risks and increase their chances of generating sales in the future.
